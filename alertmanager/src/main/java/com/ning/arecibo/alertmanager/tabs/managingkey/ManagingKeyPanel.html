                A <strong>Managing Rule</strong> represents rules for <span class="italic">disabling</span> or
                <span class="italic">quiescing</span> alerts.
                A <strong>Managing Rule</strong> can be associated with one or more <strong>Alerting
                Configurations</strong>.
                Each associated <strong>Alerting Configuration</strong> will abide by the managing rule's settings.
            </p>
            <p>
                If an <strong>Alerting Configuration</strong> has multiple Rules specified, alert suppression is invoked
                if any 1 of its <strong>Managing Rules</strong> is in effect.
            </p>
            <p>
                A <strong>Managing Rule</strong> can have both <span class="italic">scheduled</span> or
                <span class="italic">manual</span> invocation options, in which case <span class="italic">manual</span>
                invocation always takes precedence.
            </p>

            <p>

                            To associate a <strong>Managing Rule</strong> with an <strong>Alerting
                            Configuration</strong>, visit the <strong>Alerting Configurations</strong> tab.

                A Managing Rule with an action type of <strong>DISABLE</strong>, when invoked,
                will result in the managed alerting configurations to be completely disabled.
                No notifications will be sent, and no logging or state will be maintained.
            </p>

            <p>
                A Managing Rule with an action type of <strong>QUIESCE</strong>, when invoked,
                will still allow the internal management and tracking of alerting status,
                with the exception that no notification will be sent. Thus, internal alert state
                will still be maintained, and currently active alerts will still be visible in the dashboard,
                etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                If multiple Managing Rule's are in effect for a given alerting configuration,
                <strong>DISABLE</strong> actions take precedence over <strong>QUIESCE</strong> actions.
